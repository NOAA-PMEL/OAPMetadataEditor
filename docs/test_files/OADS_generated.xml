   <title>Inorganic carbon, oxygen, nutrient, and CTD measurements from the (program name from col D on other tab) 
   (cruise type - col C on cruise info tab - i.e. "Puget Sound" and/or "Sound to Sea") cruise in Washington marine waters 
   (date range from data set).</title>

   <abstract></abstract>
   
   <purpose>The major objectives of the cruise were:
1) To characterize ocean acidification (OA) conditions in the Salish Sea and adjoining coastal waters;
2) To conduct inter-calibration measurements near other OA observing assets, including moorings, in the study area, allowing inter-calibration of these autonomous assets with high-quality, ship-based measurements;
3) To provide calibration data needed to develop and validate predictive models for aragonite saturation state, pH, and other important OA indicators in the Salish Sea and adjoining coastal waters, based on widely measured parameters such as salinity, temperature, and oxygen concentration;
4) To examine relationships between processes leading to OA and hypoxia in estuarine and coastal ecosystems;
5) To conduct biological measurements in conjunction with physical and chemical OA measurements; and
6) To provide scientific information on OA conditions and trends for resource management and decision support.</purpose>

   <researchProject>Each cruise represents one or more research programs.  PRISM: The Puget Sound Regional Synthesis Model was a University of Washington initiative to better understand Puget Sound. The cruises were designed to collect a synoptic snapshot of the oceanographic conditions in Puget Sound while contributing to each of the three PRISM goals: to advance our scientific understanding of Puget Sound, to contribute to education about Puget Sound and afford opportunities for practical training, and to provide input to regional planning.  NANOOS:  The Northwest Association of Networked Ocean Observing Systems is part of U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System, designed to provide new coastal ocean data, tools, and forecasts to improve safety, enhance the economy, and better understand the environment.  The cruises were part of observations in the Salish Sea and coastal Washington.  WOAC: The Washington Ocean Acidification Center was established by the Washington State Legislature following the recommendation of the Blue Ribbon Panel on Ocean Acidification to advance the science of ocean acidification and provide a foundation for proactive strategies and policies to protect marine ecosystems and the people connected to them. A cornerstone are the survey cruises to assess OA and plankton.  NOAA OAP: NOAA's Ocean Acidification Program seeks to better prepare society to respond to changing ocean conditions and resources by expanding understanding of ocean acidification, through interdisciplinary partnerships, nationally and internationally. U.S. West Coast-wide survey cruises are sponsored by NOAA OAP every four years and contribute broader context to ocean acidification conditions observed during the Salish cruises. NOAA PMEL: NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory has partnered with PRISM, NANOOS, and WOAC to bring inorganic carbon measurements to the Salish cruises conducted under the auspices of all of these programs.</researchProject>

      <analyzingInstrument>Two systems consisting of a coulometer (UIC Inc.) coupled with a Dissolved Inorganic Carbon Extractor (DICE) inlet system. DICE was developed by Esa Peltola and Denis Pierrot of NOAA/AOML and Dana Greeley of  NOAA/PMEL to modernize a carbon extractor called SOMMA (Johnson et al. 1985, 1987, 1993, and 1999; Johnson 1992).</analyzingInstrument>
      <detailedInfo>PLEASE NOTE: DIC may be referred to as TCO2, TCARBN, or C(sub)T in other data sets.  All of these abbreviations refer to the total dissolved inorganic carbon concentration (i.e., the combined concentration of dissolved CO2, bicarbonate ion, and carbonate ion).

Samples for DIC measurements were drawn according to procedures outlined in the 2007 PICES Special Publication, Guide to Best Practices for Ocean CO2 Measurements, from Niskin bottles into ~0.5 L borosilicate glass flasks using silicone tubing. The flasks were rinsed once and filled from the bottom with care not to entrain any bubbles, overflowing by at least one-half volume. The sample tube was pinched off and withdrawn, creating a small headspace, and 0.2 mL of saturated HgCl2 solution was added as a preservative. The sample bottles were then sealed with glass stoppers lightly covered with Apiezon-L grease. DIC samples were collected from variety of depths with approximately 10% of these samples taken as duplicates.  Sample bottles were inverted several times to ensure mixing of the HgCl2 throughout the sample.

The accuracy of the DICE measurement is determined with the use of standards (Certified Reference Materials (CRMs), consisting of filtered and UV-irradiated seawater) supplied by Dr. Andrew Dickson of Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO). The CRM accuracy is determined manometrically on land in San Diego. DIC data reported to the Ocean Carbon and Acidification Data Portal have been corrected to the appropriate certified batch value.  Sample seawater from XXXX Niskin bottles was analyzed for DIC for this cruise.</detailedInfo>
      <replicate>Duplicate samples were collected from approximately 10% of the Niskins sampled, as a check of our precision.  These replicate samples were interspersed throughout the station analysis for quality assurance and integrity of the coulometer cell solutions. No systematic differences among replicates collected in deep water (>20 m depth) were observed.  However, among replicate samples collected near the surface, strong stratification of the water column can result in significant differences among replicates from the same Niskin.</replicate>
      <standard>
         <description>Each coulometer was calibrated by injecting aliquots of pure CO2 (99.999%) by means of an 8-port valve (Wilke et al. 1993) outfitted with two calibrated sample loops of different sizes (~1 mL and ~2 mL). The instruments were each separately calibrated at the beginning of each cell with a minimum of two sets of these gas loop injections and then again at the end of each cell to ensure no drift during the life of the cell. </description>
         <frequency>1) Gas loops were run at the beginning of each cell; 
2) CRM supplied by Dr. A. Dickson of SIO, were measured near the beginning; and 
3) Duplicate samples were typically run throughout the life of the cell solution.</frequency>

Samples were collected in the same bottles as DIC samples, so collection and preservation methods are described in the DIC section above.

The samples were subsequently analyzed for TA according to SOP3b of "the Guide to Best Practices for Ocean CO2 Measurements"(Dickson et al., 2007), using an open cell titration system built by the Dickson Lab in 2016 at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California San Diego.  Sample and analysis cell temperatures were controlled and sample size was measured gravimetrically.  The instrument was controlled and alkalinity determined by LabVIEW software written by the Dickson Lab.  Instrument accuracy was monitored at regular intervals using Certified Reference Materials (CRMs), consisting of filtered and UV irradiated seawater supplied by the Dickson Lab (SIO-UCSD).  Precision was monitored by analyzing replicate samples.  All samples were run ashore, with time between collection and analysis ranging from a few to several months.</detailedInfo>
      <replicate>Replicate samples were collected from approximately 10% of the Niskins sampled.  No systematic differences among replicates collected in deep water (>20 m depth) were observed.  However, among replicate samples collected near the surface, strong stratification of the water column can result in significant differences among replicates from the same Niskin.</replicate>

      <detailedInfo>A tygon tube was attached to the Niskin bottle and flushed so no air remained. A 125-mL iodine flask was inverted over the upward-pointing tube and flushed, rinsing and reverting the bottle to allow it to fill, overflowing three times its volume.  The tube was withdrawn without turbulence, maintaining an overfull bottle.  A repipettor was used to dispense 1 mL of MgCl2 and 1 mL of NaOH-NaI with Azide added. The flask was capped without introducing a bubble, inverted and mixed thoroughly, about a dozen times.  The bottle was allowed to settle, then remixed, and a bead of DI water added to the lid for an airtight seal. The analysis method is based upon the Carpenter (1965) whole flask titration of iodine, which is produced by an equivalent amount of dissolved oxygen. An automated titrator (Brinkman Dosimat) uses an amperometric end-point detection as described by Culberson and Huang (1987) and modified for IBM-PC computers by Knapp et al. (1990). The nominal 125-mL iodine flasks are used for sampling are pre-calibrated so their volumes are precisely known.  Samples were titrated within a day or two of being collected, allowing the samples to come to room temperature where the titration occured. Discrete oxygen samples were used to validate sensor O2 observations on the CTD package. </detailedInfo>

      <calcMethod>Units for both bottle and CTD oxygen concentration measurements were first converted to micromoles per kilogram.  Average values for bottle oxygen measurements were used, where replicates were taken.  Then CTD oxygen concentrations were adjusted on the basis of their offset from Winkler titration oxygen measurements from discrete bottle samples. The correction was done by way of a linear regression after outliers were excluded (all outliers were flagged as below).  All methods for doing these adjustments were described in greater detail in Alin et al. Earth System Data Science, 2018.</calcMethod>

      <flag>NOTE: Oxygen flags were not generally assigned based on factors present at the time of analysis, although in some cases, notes were taken on problems encountered at the time of analysis (e.g., bubbles in titrator or running out of reagent) and these are among the samples flagged with 3s or 4s.  Rather oxygen data were QC'ed during the course of adjusting the slope and intercept of CTD oxygen data to the bottle data by way of a linear regression.  As such, the QC flags have a slightly different meaning in this context.  We applied a QC flag of 3, denoting questionable values, strictly on the basis that the CTD-bottle oxygen data pair was an outlier in the regression.  In many cases the data may be fine and simply reflect the strong stratification in surface conditions in Puget Sound.  In other cases, one value or the other may not be good.  For those oxygen data flagged 4 (bad values), the bottle oxygen data were recognized to be bad, for reasons that may include bubbles or reagent issues or perhaps a Niskin closing at the wrong depth.  The 4s were identified on the basis of being samples from subsurface waters (>25 m depth) with concentrations that appeared to be from a substantially different depth within a given profile (whether the value was substantially too low or too high).  All other samples were presumed to be of QC level 2, although future data analyses may determine additional values to be questionable.</flag>
