    <title class="required">Partial pressure (or fugacity) of carbon dioxide, temperature, salinity and other variables collected from surface underway observations using carbon dioxide gas analyzer, shower head equilibrator and other instruments from R/V Wecoma in the U.S. West Coast California Current System during the 2011 West Coast Ocean Acidification Cruise (WCOA2011) from 2011-08-12 to 2011-08-30 (NODC Accession 0123607)</title>
    <abstract>This archival package contains the surface underway pCO2 data of the first dedicated West Coast Ocean Acidification cruise (WCOA2011). The cruise took place August 12-30, 2011 aboard the R/V Wecoma.  Ninety-five stations were occupied from northern Washington to southern California along thirteen transect lines.  At all stations, CTD casts were conducted, and discrete water samples were collected in Niskin bottles.  Underway measurements of pCO2 were collected during the duration of the cruise.  The cruise was designed to obtain a synoptic snapshot of key carbon, physical, and biogeochemical parameters as they relate to ocean acidification (OA) in the coastal realm. During the cruise, some of the same transect lines were occupied as during the 2007 West Coast Carbon cruise, as well as many CalCOFI stations. This effort was conducted in support of the coastal monitoring and research objectives of the NOAA Ocean Acidification Program (OAP).</abstract>
