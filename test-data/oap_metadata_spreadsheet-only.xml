    <title>Chemical and hydrographic profile measurements during the 2016 West Coast Ocean Acidification Cruise (WCOA2016, May 5 to June 7, 2016)</title>
    <abstract>The 2016 cruise represents the most integrated West Coast Ocean Acidification (WCOA) cruise to date. WCOA2016 took place May 5 to June 7, 2016 aboard the NOAA Ship Ronald H. Brown. 132 stations were occupied from Baja California in Mexico to Vancouver Island in Canada along seventeen transect lines.  At all stations, CTD casts were conducted, and discrete water samples were collected in Niskin bottles.  The cruise was designed to obtain a synoptic snapshot of key carbon, physical, and biogeochemical parameters as they relate to ocean acidification (OA) in the coastal realm.  Physical, biogeochemical, and chlorophyll concentration data collected during CTD casts are included with this data set. During the cruise, some of the same transect lines were occupied as during the 2007, 2011, 2012, and 2013 West Coast Ocean Acidification cruises, as well as CalCOFI cruises. This effort was conducted in support of the coastal monitoring and research objectives of the NOAA Ocean Acidification Program (OAP).

Data Use Policy: Data from NOAA West Coast Ocean Acidification (WCOA) cruises are made freely available to the public and the scientific community in the belief that their wide dissemination will lead to greater understanding and new scientific and policy insights. The investigators sharing these data rely on the ethics and integrity of the user to ensure that the institutions and investigators involved in producing the WCOA cruise data sets receive fair credit for their work.  If the data are obtained for potential use in a publication or presentation, we urge the end user to inform the investigators listed herein at the outset of the nature of this work. If these data are essential to the work, or if an important result or conclusion depends on these data, co-authorship may be appropriate.  This should be discussed at an early stage in the work.  We request that any manuscripts using these data be sent to all investigators listed in the metadata before they are submitted for publication so that we can ensure that the quality and limitations of the data are accurately represented.  Please direct all queries about this data set to Simone Alin and Richard Feely.</abstract>
    <purpose>The major objectives of the cruise were:
1) To characterize ocean acidification (OA) conditions on the North American Pacific Coast;
2) To conduct inter-calibration measurements near other OA observing assets, including moorings, in the study area, allowing inter-calibration of these autonomous assets with high-quality, ship-based measurements;
3) To provide calibration data needed to develop predictive models for aragonite saturation state, pH, and other important OA indicators in the California Current Ecosystem, based on widely measured parameters such as salinity, temperature, and oxygen concentration;
4) To examine relationships between processes leading to OA and hypoxia in coastal ecosystems;
5) To conduct biological measurements in conjunction with physical and chemical OA measurements; and
6) To provide scientific information on OA conditions and trends for resource management and decision support.</purpose>

            <analyzingInstrument>Two systems consisting of a coulometer (UIC Inc.) coupled with a Dissolved Inorganic Carbon Extractor (DICE) inlet system. DICE was developed by Esa Peltola and Denis Pierrot of NOAA/AOML and Dana Greeley of  NOAA/PMEL to modernize a carbon extractor called SOMMA (Johnson et al. 1985, 1987, 1993, and 1999; Johnson 1992).</analyzingInstrument>
            <detailedInfo>PLEASE NOTE: DIC may also be referred to as TCO2, TCARBN, or C(sub)T in other data sets.  All of these abbreviations refer to the total dissolved inorganic carbon concentration (i.e., the combined concentration of dissolved CO2, bicarbonate ion, and carbonate ion).

Samples for DIC measurements were drawn according to procedures outlined in the 2007 PICES Special Publication, Guide to Best Practices for Ocean CO2 Measurements, from Niskin bottles into 310 ml borosilicate glass flasks using silicone tubing. The flasks were rinsed once and filled from the bottom with care not to entrain any bubbles, overflowing by at least one-half volume. The sample tube was pinched off and withdrawn, creating a ~7.5 ml headspace, and 0.12 ml of saturated HgCl2 solution was added as a preservative. The sample bottles were then sealed with glass stoppers lightly covered with Apiezon-L grease. DIC samples were collected from variety of depths with approximately 10% of these samples taken as duplicates.

The accuracy of the DICE measurement is determined with the use of standards (Certified Reference Materials (CRMs), consisting of filtered and UV irradiated seawater) supplied by Dr. Andrew Dickson of Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO). The CRM accuracy is determined manometrically on land in San Diego and the DIC data reported to the Ocean Carbon and Acidification Data Portal have been corrected to this batch 154 CRM value.  The CRM certified value for this batch is 2037.68 umol/kg. System 1 averaged 2033.64 and system 2 averaged 2036.88. The overall performance of the analytical equipment was quite good.  Water from 1704 niskin bottles were analyzed for dissolved inorganic carbon.</detailedInfo>
            <fieldReplicateHandling>Duplicate samples were collected from approximately 10% of the Niskins sampled, as a check of our precision.  These replicate samples were interspersed throughout the station analysis for quality assurance and integrity of the coulometer cell solutions. The average absolute difference from the mean of these replicates is 0.82 umol/kg.  No systematic differences between the replicates were observed.</fieldReplicateHandling>
            <standardization>
                <description>Each coulometer was calibrated by injecting aliquots of pure CO2 (99.999%) by means of an 8-port valve (Wilke et al. 1993) outfitted with two calibrated sample loops of different sizes (~1 mL and ~2 mL). The instruments were each separately calibrated at the beginning of each cell with a minimum of two sets of these gas loop injections.</description>
                <frequency>1) Gas loops were run near the beginning of each cell; 2) CRM’s supplied by Dr. A. Dickson of SIO, were also measured near the beginning; and 3) Duplicate samples were typically run throughout the life of the cell solution.</frequency>

            <detailedInfo>PLEASE NOTE: TA may be referred to as TALK, ALKALI, or A(sub)T in other data sets.  All of these abbreviations refer to the total alkalinity.

Seawater samples for total alkalinity were drawn directly from Niskin bottles into 310 mL borosilicate glass (Corning Pyrex/Schott Duran) bottles as described in SOP1 of “The Guide to Best Practices for Ocean CO2 Measurements” (Dickson A.G., Sabine L.S. and Christian J.R, Eds., 2007 PICES Special Publication 3), using silicone tubing.   The flasks were rinsed three times and filled from the bottom with care not to entrain any bubbles, overflowing by at least one full volume. The sample tube was pinched off and withdrawn, creating a ~6.2 mL headspace and preserved with 0.12 mL of a saturated mercuric chloride solution and the final alkalinity concentration corrected for this addition.  The bottles were then sealed with glass stoppers lightly coated with Apiezon-L grease.

The samples were subsequently analyzed according to SOP3b of “The Guide to Best Practices for Ocean CO2 Measurements” (as above), using an open cell titration system built by the Dickson Lab in 2016 at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California San Diego.  Sample and analysis cell temperatures were controlled and sample size was measured volumetrically and subsequently corrected to mass.  The instrument was controlled and alkalinity determined by LabVIEW software written by the Dickson Lab.  Instrument accuracy was monitored at regular intervals using Certified Reference Materials (CRMs), consisting of filtered and UV irradiated seawater supplied by the Dickson Lab (SIO-UCSD).  Precision was monitored by analyzing replicate samples drawn from approximately 10% of the Niskins sampled.  Samples were analyzed within 12 hours of being collected except for stations 134 and 135, which were run ashore.</detailedInfo>
            <fieldReplicateHandling>We collected and analyzed duplicate samples from approximately 10% of the Niskins sampled.</fieldReplicateHandling>
            <standardization>
                <description>Analytical accuracy was assessed by periodic analysis of Certified Reference Materials (CRMs) throughout the cruise. CRMs were analyzed approximately every 20 samples or less as needed.  For both legs of this cruise, the CRM used was Batch 154 (certified = 2224.30).  The average measured CRM on Leg 1 was 2224.93 with a standard deviation of 1.65 and a range of 7.04.  For Leg 2, the average CRM was 2225.07 with a standard deviation of 1.35 and a range of 6.82.   These higher than typical SD and range resulted from a less precise commercially sourced voltage amplifier used during the cruise.  Samples analyzed on shore after the cruise (Stations 134 and 135), used CRM batches 154 and 145 (certified = 2226.16) with average measurements of 2223.20 (SD = 0.76, range = 2.06) and 2226.03 (SD = 1.34, range = 3.27).   No corrections were made for the offset between the certified and measured CRM's.  Precision was monitored by analyzing replicates drawn from approximately 10% of the Niskins sampled.</description>

            <detailedInfo>Samples were collected for pH analysis immediately following O2 in the Niskin/Rosette sampling sequence. Seawater samples were collected from the Niskin bottles directly in 10-cm cylindrical optical cells (~30 mL volume) using a section of silicone tubing (about 15 cm long). One end of the silicone tubing was attached to the optical cell and the other end was attached to the nipple of the Niskin bottle. The Niskin bottle nipple was pushed in to initiate flow and the silicone tubing was squeezed to eliminate air bubbles. The optical cell was agitated to eliminate bubbles and, after 15 seconds of sample flow, the cell was capped at one end. The silicone tubing was then detached from the optical cell and, with the water still flowing, the cap was rinsed and used to seal the optical cell. Samples collected this way were not exposed to the atmosphere, and each cell was flushed with approximately three cell volumes of seawater. The samples were collected, taken into the lab, and rinsed with tap water to get rid of salt outside of the cells. The cells were dried and the optical windows were cleaned with Kimwipes. Samples were thermostatted at 25 (±0.05)°C in a custom made 36-position cell warmer. A custom macro program running on Agilent ChemStation was used to guide the measurements and data processing. The macro automated the procedures of sample input, blank and sample scans, quality control, and data archiving. The quality control steps included checking the baseline shift after dye injection and monitoring the standard deviation of multiple scans. Absorbance blanks were taken for each sample and 10 microliters of purified m-cresol purple (10 mmol/kg) were added for the analysis. pHT (total scale) for shipboard conditions (25 °C at atmospheric pressure) was calculated according to Liu et al. (2011).</detailedInfo>

            <detailedInfo>The Sea-Bird 9plus CTD uses a Paroscientific Digiquartz pressure sensor. This high pressure transducer uses a quartz crystal resonator whose frequency of oscillation varies with pressure-induced stress measuring changes in pressure as small as 0.01 parts per million with an absolute range of 0 to 10,000 psia (0 to 6885 decibars).  Also, a quartz crystal temperature signal is used to compensate for a wide range of temperature changes.  Repeatability, hysteresis, and pressure conformance are 0.005% FS.  The nominal pressure frequency (0 to full scale) is 34 to 38 kHz.  The nominal temperature frequency is 172 kHz + 50 ppm/°C.  Data are acquired at 24 Hz.  Discrete pressure data were averaged over an 8-second interval, ±4 seconds of the sample confirm bit.  Periodic pressure sensor calibrations are performed at Sea-Bird Electronics, Inc.  No additional adjustments were applied.</detailedInfo>

Exponentially related to temperature, the thermistor resistance is the controlling element in an optimized Wien Bridge oscillator circuit. The resulting sensor frequency is inversely proportional to the square root of the thermistor resistance and ranges from approximately 2 to 6 kHz, corresponding to temperatures from -5 to 35°C.  The 3plus temperature sensor has a typical accuracy/stability of 0.0002°C per month; and resolution of 0.0002°C at 24 Hz.

            <samplingInstrument>Sea-Bird 4 conductivity sensor</samplingInstrument>
            <detailedInfo>The Sea-Bird conductivity sensing element is a cylindrical, flow-through, borosilicate glass cell with three internal platinum electrodes. Because the outer electrodes are connected together, electric fields are confined inside the cell.  The cell resistance controls the output frequency of a Wien Bridge oscillator circuit.  The sensor has a frequency output of approximately 3 to 12 kHz corresponding to conductivities from 0 to 7 Siemens/meter (0 to 70 mmho/cm).  The conductivity sensor has a typical accuracy/stability of 0.0003 S/m per month, and resolution of 0.00004 S/m at 24 Hz.  Discrete conductivity data were averaged over an 8-second interval, ±4 seconds of the sample confirm bit.  An overall linear fit of CTD and bottle data, including a station-dependent slope, single conductivity bias, and a linear pressure term (modified beta; with a coefficient multiplied by CTD pressure), produced the best results for stations 4-86 and 87-135.  The fitting routine recursively throws out data greater than 2.8 standard deviations and returns a single conductivity bias, conductivity slope, and pressure term coefficient for each station.  A station-dependent slope coefficient best models the gradual shift in the conductivity sensor within each station grouping with time.  The order of the polynomial was chosen to keep the standard deviation of each grouping to a minimum while avoiding fitting to fluctuations due to noise in standardizations of salinity sample runs.  Discrete salinity values were derived from calibrated conductivity, temperature, and pressure measurements.</detailedInfo>

            <detailedInfo>The Sea-Bird oxygen sensor uses an electrochemical cell that is constantly polarized.  The sensor is temperature compensated using special temperature sensing and an internal microcomputer.  The interface electronics reports voltages for oxygen current only.  A linear equation of the form I=mV+b, where m=1.0e-6 and b=0.0, yields sensor current as a function of sensor output voltage.  The sensor has a thermal time constant of approximately 2.5 seconds; and an oxygen response time constant that is temperature dependent, increasing with cooler temperatures, ranging from 2 to 12 seconds.
Hysteresis between the down and up oxygen profiles at deep stations warranted using the downcast oxygen data for calibration, matched by potential density anomalies referenced to the closest 1000-m interval.  An overall least squares fit was determined for each of the two oxygen sensors used during this cruise.</detailedInfo>

For the nitrate + nitrite analysis, nitrate is first reduced to nitrite using an OTCR and imidazole buffer as described by Patton (1983). Nitrite analysis is performed on a separate channel, omitting the cadmium reductor and the buffer.</detailedInfo>

            <detailedInfo>Samples were collected in amber 250 mL HDPE bottles and filtered onto Whatman GF/F filters (25-mm diameter) within 30 minutes of collection. Each filter was then placed inside a borosilicate glass tube and stored frozen (-20 deg C) until analysis. Chlorophyll was extracted in the dark at -20 deg C using 90 % (v/v) over a period not exceeding 24 h, and subsequently analyzed by in vitro fluorometry using the non-acidification method of Welschmeyer (1994). Concentrations of chlorophyll estimated from samples collected with these glass fiber filters (nominal pore size of 0.7 um) represent the chlorophyll from the total phytoplankton community.</detailedInfo>
