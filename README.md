# OAP Metadata Editor
This is a Grails-based Web-app for entering and editing OAP Metadata. Capabilities include:

1. Users can enter from scratch metadata by filling out the form which gives feedback on the validity of the entries as each section is saved.
2. Users can save the resulting metadata to an XML file on their local system.
3. Users can upload an existing XML file which will populate the user interface, which can then be edited and saved to either make changes to an exsiting entry or to start a new entry based on a previous one.

The uploaded and saved metadata files are stored on the server by EXPOCODE.
